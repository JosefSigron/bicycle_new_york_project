# Manhattan Bicycle Usage Analysis

This module provides specialized analysis of Citibike ridership patterns specifically within Manhattan, offering detailed insights into the borough's unique cycling characteristics, regional patterns, and temporal dynamics.

## Overview

The `manhattan_analysis.py` script conducts comprehensive analysis of Manhattan's Citibike system, dividing the borough into distinct regions and examining how geographical, temporal, and demographic factors influence bicycle usage patterns. With Manhattan being the densest and most active borough for bike sharing, this analysis provides crucial insights for urban transportation planning.

## Key Features

### Regional Division

Manhattan is divided into four analytical regions based on geographical and functional characteristics:

**Regional Boundaries**:
- **Downtown** (≤ 14th Street): Financial District, Tribeca, SoHo, Greenwich Village
- **Midtown** (14th - 59th Street): Chelsea, Flatiron, Hell's Kitchen, Times Square  
- **Central Park Area** (59th - 86th Street): Upper East/West Side South, Central Park
- **Upper Manhattan** (≥ 86th Street): Upper East/West Side North, Harlem

### Analysis Components

#### 1. **Trip Duration Analysis**
- Regional median and mean trip durations
- Distribution analysis across Manhattan regions
- Comparison with other boroughs
- Temporal patterns in trip length

#### 2. **Origin-Destination Analysis**
- Most popular start and end stations by region
- Inter-regional flow patterns
- Peak usage locations and times
- Spatial distribution of rides

#### 3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
- Hourly ridership patterns by region
- Weekday vs weekend usage differences
- Seasonal variations across Manhattan
- Rush hour dynamics and commuting patterns

#### 4. **Station Performance Analysis**
- Busiest stations by trip volume
- Station utilization rates
- Geographic clustering of high-activity stations
- Balance between origins and destinations

#### 5. **User Type Analysis**
- Subscriber vs customer patterns by region
- Usage duration differences between user types
- Regional preferences and behaviors
- Demographic insights from usage patterns

## Core Functions

### Data Processing

**Regional Classification**: Automatically assigns each trip to Manhattan regions based on start station coordinates and street-level boundaries.

**Data Filtering**: Focuses analysis on trips originating within Manhattan boundaries while maintaining connections to other boroughs for comprehensive flow analysis.

**Statistical Analysis**: Computes comprehensive statistics including medians, means, percentiles, and distributions for all key metrics.

### Visualization Generation

**Geographic Plots**: Creates maps showing station locations, usage intensity, and regional boundaries within Manhattan.

**Temporal Visualizations**: Generates time-series plots, heatmaps, and seasonal pattern charts specific to Manhattan usage.

**Comparative Analysis**: Produces side-by-side comparisons between Manhattan regions and with other boroughs.

## Analysis Outputs

### Statistical Summaries
- Regional trip statistics (count, duration, distance)
- Station-level performance metrics
- User type breakdowns by region
- Temporal usage patterns

### Visualizations

## Manhattan-Specific Insights

### Urban Density Effects
- **High Turnover**: Short average trip durations due to dense station network
- **Peak Congestion**: Analysis of rush hour bottlenecks and capacity issues
- **Tourist vs Commuter**: Different usage patterns in business vs tourist areas

### Regional Characteristics
- **Downtown**: Financial district commuting patterns, weekend tourist activity
- **Midtown**: Heavy business usage, tourist attractions, transportation hubs  
- **Central Park**: Recreational cycling, longer duration trips, seasonal patterns
- **Upper Manhattan**: Residential commuting, lower overall density

### Transportation Integration
- **Subway Connections**: Analysis of bike-share as first/last mile solution
- **Bridge Access**: Usage patterns for inter-borough connections
- **Traffic Patterns**: Correlation with vehicle traffic and congestion

## Performance Metrics

### Efficiency Indicators
- **Station Utilization**: Trips per station per day by region
- **Turnover Rate**: How quickly bikes are cycled through stations
- **Capacity Utilization**: Peak vs off-peak usage ratios

### Geographic Distribution
- **Coverage Analysis**: Station density per square mile by region
- **Accessibility**: Distance analysis to nearest stations
- **Usage Concentration**: Identification of high-activity corridors

## Usage Example

```python
from manhattan_analysis import analyze_manhattan_data

# Run comprehensive Manhattan analysis
results = analyze_manhattan_data('data/combined/')

# Access regional statistics
regional_stats = results['regional_summary']
station_rankings = results['station_performance']
temporal_patterns = results['temporal_analysis']
```
