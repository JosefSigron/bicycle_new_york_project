# Two-Phase Infrastructure Analysis: Model Logic and Issues

## Overview

The analysis uses two different models with different training data and objectives:

## Phase 1 Model (Baseline/Discovery)
**Goal**: Train on pre-infrastructure data to predict post-infrastructure usage and identify gaps

### Training Data:
- **Year**: 2022 only
- **Features**: Basic features WITHOUT infrastructure knowledge
- **Model**: GradientBoostingRegressor (simpler parameters)

### Features Used (Phase 1):
```python
base_features = [
    'month',                    # Seasonal patterns
    'start_station_latitude',   # Location
    'start_station_longitude',  # Location  
    'avg_temp',                # Weather
    'avg_humidity',            # Weather
    'avg_wind_speed',          # Weather
    'avg_precipitation'        # Weather
]
# Plus: weather_cat_* and utci_cat_* dummy variables
# Total: ~15-20 features (basic)
```

### Prediction Target:
- Predicts **2023** usage using 2022 patterns
- Model has NO knowledge of 2022 or 2023 infrastructure

### Gap Calculation:
```python
# Phase 1 Gap = Actual 2023 - Predicted 2023 (using 2022 model)
usage_gap = actual_2023 - predicted_2023_from_2022_model
# Positive gaps = stations performing better than expected
# Expected: Infrastructure-affected stations should have positive gaps
```

## Phase 2 Model (Enhanced/Validation)
**Goal**: Train on post-infrastructure data with full infrastructure knowledge to validate methodology

### Training Data:
- **Year**: 2023 only
- **Features**: Enhanced features WITH full infrastructure knowledge
- **Model**: Best of GradientBoostingRegressor vs RandomForestRegressor (with model selection)

### Features Used (Phase 2):
```python
# Same base features as Phase 1 PLUS 16 infrastructure features:
infrastructure_features = [
    # Legacy binary features
    'near_infrastructure_2022', 'near_infrastructure_2023', 'infrastructure_density',
    
    # Distance-based features  
    'min_dist_infra_2022', 'min_dist_infra_2023',
    'weighted_infra_proximity_2022', 'weighted_infra_proximity_2023',
    
    # Time-based features
    'months_since_nearest_infra', 'infrastructure_maturity_score',
    
    # Zone-based graduated effects
    'high_impact_zone_count', 'medium_impact_zone_count', 'low_impact_zone_count',
    
    # Network effects
    'infra_density_500m', 'infra_density_1000m', 'infra_network_centrality',
    
    # Interaction features
    'infra_weather_interaction', 'infra_seasonal_interaction',
    
    # Non-linear transformations
    'infra_exponential_decay', 'infra_sigmoid_effect'
]
# Total: ~35-40 features (enhanced)
```

### Prediction Target:
- Predicts **2024** usage using 2023 patterns with infrastructure knowledge
- Model KNOWS about both 2022 and 2023 infrastructure

### Gap Calculation:
```python
# Phase 2 Gap = Actual 2024 - Predicted 2024 (using enhanced 2023 model)
usage_gap = actual_2024 - predicted_2024_from_enhanced_2023_model
# Small gaps = model captures infrastructure effects well
# Expected: Infrastructure-affected stations should have small gaps
```

## Key Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Time-Based Features Logic Error
**Location**: Lines 1091-1100 in `_add_infrastructure_features`

**Problem**:
```python
# BROKEN: This condition will never be True
if nearest_dist in distances_2022:
    months_since = 6 + month  # 2022 infrastructure
else:
    months_since = max(0, month - 6)  # 2023 infrastructure
```

**Why it's broken**: 
- `nearest_dist` is a float (e.g., 245.7)  
- `distances_2022` is a list (e.g., [245.7, 589.2, 1200.3])
- Float will never equal a list, so condition always False

### Issue 2: Arbitrary Infrastructure Installation Dates
**Problem**: Code assumes all infrastructure was installed in month 6 (June)
```python
# ASSUMPTION: All 2022 infra installed in month 6, all 2023 infra in month 6
# This is arbitrary and may not reflect reality
```

### Issue 3: Feature Engineering Issues
1. **Redundant infrastructure_density**: Just weighted sum of binaries
2. **Inconsistent distance thresholds**: Uses 300m/600m/1000m zones but elsewhere uses adaptive buffers
3. **Arbitrary decay constants**: 500m decay, 400m sigmoid midpoint without justification

### Issue 4: Model Training Data Confusion
**Phase 2 Issue**: Enhanced model trains on 2023 data but includes 2022 infrastructure features
- Could create confusion about temporal relationships
- 2022 features might not be relevant for predicting 2024 from 2023

### Issue 5: Gap Interpretation Clarity
**Current gaps represent different things**:
- Phase 1: "How much does infrastructure boost usage beyond baseline expectations?"
- Phase 2: "How well does our enhanced model capture infrastructure effects?"

These are fundamentally different questions with opposite "good" directions.

## Proposed Fixes

### Fix 1: Correct Time-Based Features
```python
# Find which year's infrastructure is closest
min_dist_2022 = min(distances_2022) if distances_2022 else float('inf')
min_dist_2023 = min(distances_2023) if distances_2023 else float('inf')

# Determine which infrastructure is nearest
if min_dist_2022 < min_dist_2023:
    # 2022 infrastructure is nearest
    nearest_year = 2022
    nearest_dist = min_dist_2022
else:
    # 2023 infrastructure is nearest
    nearest_year = 2023  
    nearest_dist = min_dist_2023
```

### Fix 2: Use Actual Infrastructure Installation Dates
```python
# Instead of assuming month 6, use actual installation dates from data
# Or use a more realistic assumption based on construction seasons
installation_month_2022 = 8  # Late summer construction
installation_month_2023 = 9  # Late summer construction
```

### Fix 3: Align Distance Thresholds with Adaptive Buffers
```python
# Use the same adaptive buffer system for zone classification
base_buffer = self._get_adaptive_buffer_size(station_info)
high_impact_threshold = base_buffer * 0.7  # ~300-500m depending on street
medium_impact_threshold = base_buffer * 1.0  # ~400-600m
low_impact_threshold = base_buffer * 1.4     # ~600-900m
```

### Fix 4: Simplify Phase 2 Features
For Phase 2, focus on infrastructure maturity and network effects rather than historical 2022 features:
```python
# Phase 2 should focus on current infrastructure state, not historical
simplified_phase2_features = [
    'total_nearby_infrastructure',  # Combined 2022+2023
    'infrastructure_maturity_months',
    'network_density',
    'distance_to_nearest',
    'weather_infrastructure_interaction'
]
```

### Fix 5: Clarify Objectives
```python
# Phase 1: Discovery (WANT high positive gaps for affected stations)
# Interpretation: "Infrastructure causes usage above baseline expectations"

# Phase 2: Validation (WANT low absolute gaps for all stations)  
# Interpretation: "Enhanced model captures infrastructure effects well"
```

## Fixes Applied

### âœ… Fixed Critical Distance Logic Bug (Lines 1084-1129)
**Before**: `if nearest_dist in distances_2022:` (always False)
**After**: Proper logic to determine which year's infrastructure is closest:
```python
min_dist_2022 = min(distances_2022) if distances_2022 else float('inf')
min_dist_2023 = min(distances_2023) if distances_2023 else float('inf')
if min_dist_2022 < min_dist_2023:
    nearest_year = 2022
```

### âœ… Realistic Installation Dates (Lines 1097-1122)
**Before**: Arbitrary month 6 for all infrastructure
**After**: Realistic construction season timing:
- 2022 infrastructure: August installation
- 2023 infrastructure: September installation

### âœ… Adaptive Distance Thresholds (Lines 1131-1144)
**Before**: Fixed 300m/600m/1000m zones
**After**: Adaptive zones based on base buffer:
```python
base_buffer_meters = 0.005 * 111000  # ~555m
high_impact_threshold = base_buffer_meters * 0.7    # ~390m
medium_impact_threshold = base_buffer_meters * 1.0  # ~555m
low_impact_threshold = base_buffer_meters * 1.4     # ~775m
```

### âœ… Improved Infrastructure Density (Lines 1022-1026)
**Before**: Simple weighted sum
**After**: Cumulative effect consideration:
```python
data['infrastructure_density'] = (
    data['near_infrastructure_2022'] * 0.6 +  # Earlier infrastructure
    data['near_infrastructure_2023'] * 1.0 +  # Recent infrastructure  
    (data['near_infrastructure_2022'] & data['near_infrastructure_2023']) * 0.4  # Bonus
)
```

### âœ… Adaptive Non-Linear Features (Lines 1170-1181)
**Before**: Fixed 500m decay, 400m sigmoid
**After**: Adaptive parameters:
```python
decay_constant = base_buffer_meters * 0.9  # ~500m adaptive
sigmoid_midpoint = base_buffer_meters * 0.7  # ~390m adaptive
```

### âœ… Clear Model Objectives Documentation
Added comprehensive comments explaining:
- **Phase 1**: Discovery model (want HIGH positive gaps)
- **Phase 2**: Validation model (want LOW absolute gaps)
- Gap interpretation for each phase

## Model Logic Summary

### Phase 1 (Discovery)
```python
# Train: 2022 data (no infrastructure knowledge)
# Predict: 2023 usage

```python
# Train: 2023 data (full infrastructure knowledge)
# Predict: 2024 usage
# Gaps: Actual_2024 - Predicted_2024
# Success: LOW absolute gaps everywhere
```
