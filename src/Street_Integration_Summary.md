# NYC Street Data Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated NYC LION (Linear Integrated Ordered Network) street data into your infrastructure analysis to provide more accurate buffer zones and enhanced model features.

## Key Improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Street-Specific Buffer Zones**
Instead of using a uniform 500m buffer, the system now uses street-specific buffers based on street classification:

- **Major Streets** (60+ ft width, 3+ lanes): **750m buffer**
- **Arterial Streets** (40-60 ft width, 2 lanes): **600m buffer** 
- **Local Streets** (<40 ft width, 1 lane): **450m buffer**
- **Service Roads**: **300m buffer**

### ðŸ”§ **Enhanced Model Features**
Your models now include additional street classification features:

**New Features Added:**
- `near_major_street_infra`: Binary indicator for infrastructure on major streets
- `near_arterial_street_infra`: Binary indicator for infrastructure on arterial streets  
- `near_local_street_infra`: Binary indicator for infrastructure on local streets
- `avg_street_width`: Average width of nearby infrastructure streets (feet)
- `max_travel_lanes`: Maximum travel lanes of nearby infrastructure streets

**Existing Features Enhanced:**
- More accurate `near_infrastructure` detection using street-specific buffers
- Better `min_infra_distance` calculations
- Improved spillover effect analysis

## Data Source: NYC LION Dataset

**What is LION?**
- Official NYC Department of City Planning street centerline database
- Contains 241,934+ street segments across all 5 boroughs
- Includes detailed attributes: street width, travel lanes, traffic direction, etc.

**Key Columns Used:**
- `FeatureTyp`: Street type classification (0=Street, 1=Path, 2=Ramp, etc.)
- `SegmentTyp`: Segment type (U=Undifferentiated, R=Roadbed, etc.)
- `StreetWidth_Min/Max`: Actual street width measurements
- `Number_Travel_Lanes`: Count of travel lanes
- `SHAPE_Length`: Segment length for accurate calculations

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`src/nyc_street_loader.py`** (NEW)
   - Loads and processes NYC LION data
   - Classifies streets by importance and size
   - Calculates appropriate buffer zones
   - Provides infrastructure enhancement functions

2. **`src/clean_infrastructure_analysis.py`** (ENHANCED)
   - Integrated NYCStreetLoader
   - Enhanced `_identify_affected_stations()` with street-specific buffers
   - Added `_find_affected_stations_with_street_buffers()` method
   - Enhanced `_add_infrastructure_features()` with street classification
   - Updated model training to include street features

3. **`test_street_integration.py`** (NEW)
   - Tests street loader functionality
   - Verifies integration compatibility
   - Provides validation before running full analysis

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Test the Integration**
```bash
python test_street_integration.py
```

### 2. **Run Enhanced Analysis**
```bash
python src/clean_infrastructure_analysis.py
```

### 3. **Review Results**
The analysis will now generate:
- More accurate affected station identification
- Enhanced model performance with street features
- Better understanding of infrastructure impact by street type

## Expected Impact

### ðŸŽ¯ **More Accurate Analysis**
- **Better Buffer Zones**: Major roads get larger impact zones, local roads get smaller ones
- **Realistic Impact Detection**: Accounts for actual street importance and size
- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Street features help models understand infrastructure context

### ðŸ“Š **Enhanced Insights**
- **Street Type Effects**: See how infrastructure performs differently on major vs. local streets
- **Context-Aware Predictions**: Models understand that major street infrastructure has wider impact
- **Detailed Feature Analysis**: Understand which street characteristics drive cycling infrastructure success

```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Test**: Verify everything works with `python test_street_integration.py`
2. **Execute Analysis**: Run the enhanced analysis and compare results
3. **Review Performance**: Check if model accuracy improves with street features
4. **Analyze Results**: Look for patterns in how different street types affect cycling infrastructure effectiveness

## Technical Notes

- **Caching**: Street data is cached after first load for faster subsequent runs
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if street data unavailable  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only essential street attributes are kept in memory
- **Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible with existing analysis

The integration maintains all existing functionality while adding powerful new street-aware capabilities to your infrastructure analysis.
