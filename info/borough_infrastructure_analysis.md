# Borough-Level Infrastructure Impact Analysis

This module extends the two-phase infrastructure analysis to include borough-level comparisons, providing insights into how infrastructure improvements affect different NYC boroughs differently and testing whether infrastructure effects are consistent across geographic areas.

## Overview

The borough-level analysis addresses a critical gap in the original infrastructure impact assessment: **Are infrastructure improvements equally effective across all NYC boroughs, or do borough-specific characteristics influence their success?**

This analysis provides a more robust causal inference framework by:
1. **Comparing infrastructure-improved boroughs vs non-improved boroughs**
2. **Controlling for borough-specific baseline trends**
3. **Testing statistical significance of borough differences**
4. **Identifying which boroughs benefit most from infrastructure investments**

## Key Research Questions

### 1. Borough Effectiveness Comparison
- **Question**: Do infrastructure improvements work equally well in Manhattan vs Brooklyn vs Queens vs Bronx?
- **Method**: Calculate infrastructure impact separately for each borough
- **Output**: Borough-specific effectiveness scores and impact measurements

### 2. Geographic Treatment vs Control
- **Question**: Do boroughs that received infrastructure improvements show different ridership patterns than those that didn't?
- **Method**: Group boroughs into "improved" vs "non-improved" and compare aggregate metrics
- **Output**: Statistical tests for significance of between-group differences

### 3. Infrastructure Investment Efficiency
- **Question**: Which boroughs provide the highest return on infrastructure investment?
- **Method**: Calculate rides/month impact per infrastructure point by borough
- **Output**: Investment efficiency rankings and recommendations

## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Borough Infrastructure Mapping
```python
# Identify which boroughs received infrastructure improvements
infrastructure_by_borough = {
    'manhattan': 15 infrastructure points,
    'brooklyn': 8 infrastructure points,
    'queens': 2 infrastructure points,
    'bronx': 0 infrastructure points
}

# Classify boroughs
improved_boroughs = ['manhattan', 'brooklyn', 'queens']
non_improved_boroughs = ['bronx']
```

### Phase 2: Borough-Specific Impact Calculation
For each borough individually:
```python
# Within-borough analysis
affected_stations = stations_with_nearby_infrastructure
unaffected_stations = stations_without_nearby_infrastructure

borough_infrastructure_impact = (
    avg_gap_affected_stations - avg_gap_unaffected_stations
)
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Borough Comparison
```python
# Between-borough analysis
improved_boroughs_avg_impact = mean([manhattan_impact, brooklyn_impact, queens_impact])
non_improved_boroughs_avg_gap = bronx_overall_gap

net_infrastructure_benefit = improved_boroughs_avg_impact - non_improved_boroughs_avg_gap
```

### Phase 4: Statistical Testing
- **Mann-Whitney U Test**: Non-parametric test for significance
- **Independent t-test**: Parametric comparison of borough groups
- **Cohen's d**: Effect size measurement
- **Confidence intervals**: Uncertainty quantification

Four-panel visualization showing:
- Infrastructure contribution by borough (rides/month per station)
- Number of affected stations per borough
- Effectiveness score by borough
- Impact per infrastructure investment

### 2. Improved vs Non-Improved Borough Groups
**File**: `improved_vs_non_improved_comparison.png`

## Statistical Interpretation

### Significance Levels
- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant difference
- **p < 0.01**: Highly significant difference
- **p < 0.001**: Very highly significant difference

### Effect Size (Cohen's d)
- **d < 0.2**: Negligible effect
- **0.2 ≤ d < 0.5**: Small effect
- **0.5 ≤ d < 0.8**: Medium effect
- **d ≥ 0.8**: Large effect

### Example Interpretation
```
Statistical test results:
  Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.0023 (significant)
  Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.65 (medium)

Interpretation: Boroughs with infrastructure improvements 
show significantly higher ridership increases than those 
without improvements, with a medium-to-large effect size.
```

## Business Value

### Policy Insights
1. **Resource Allocation**: Identify which boroughs benefit most from infrastructure investment
2. **Equity Analysis**: Determine if infrastructure benefits are equitably distributed
3. **ROI Optimization**: Focus future investments on high-impact boroughs

### Causal Inference Strength

## Usage Example

```python
from borough_infrastructure_analysis import BoroughInfrastructureAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = BoroughInfrastructureAnalyzer(
    data_folder="data/combined",
    street_coords_file="data/nyc_street_coords.csv"
)

# Run comprehensive borough analysis
results = analyzer.run_borough_analysis()

# Access results
borough_impacts = results['borough_impacts']
group_comparison = results['borough_comparison']
statistical_tests = results['statistical_tests']

# Check statistical significance
if statistical_tests['mann_whitney']['significant']:
    print("Infrastructure effects vary significantly between boroughs!")
```

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and borough filtering
- **numpy**: Statistical calculations and aggregations
- **scipy.stats**: Statistical testing (Mann-Whitney U, t-tests)
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Borough-level visualizations
- **sklearn**: Effect size calculations

### Data Requirements
- **Borough information**: `start_borough` column in trip data
- **Infrastructure coordinates**: Latitude/longitude of improvements
- **Station coordinates**: For proximity-based impact assignment
- **Temporal data**: Multi-year data for baseline vs treatment comparison

### Memory Optimization
- **Year-by-year processing**: Avoids loading all data simultaneously
- **Borough chunking**: Processes one borough at a time for large datasets
- **Selective loading**: Only loads necessary columns for borough analysis

## Limitations and Considerations

### Geographic Boundaries
- Uses approximate borough boundaries based on coordinate ranges
- May misclassify stations near borough borders
- Could be improved with official NYC borough shapefiles

### Sample Size Requirements
- Requires sufficient stations in each borough for statistical power
- May be underpowered for boroughs with few infrastructure improvements
- Statistical tests assume adequate sample sizes

### Temporal Assumptions
- Assumes infrastructure effects are relatively consistent over time
- May not capture seasonal variations in infrastructure effectiveness
- Could be extended to month-by-month analysis for temporal patterns

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Neighborhood-Level Analysis
Extend beyond borough level to Community Board or ZIP code analysis for finer geographic resolution.

### 2. Infrastructure Type Classification
Separate analysis by type of infrastructure (bike lanes, station additions, safety improvements).

### 3. Socioeconomic Integration
Incorporate demographic and economic data to understand infrastructure equity impacts.

### 4. Temporal Dynamics
Add month-by-month or season-by-season analysis to understand when infrastructure effects are strongest.
